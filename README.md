JAVAWebDriverPlugAndPlay
========================

This is a skeletion framework for testing web applications. The combination used is the following:
* Selenium Webdriver for driving the browser
* JAVA for writing the tests
* TestNG as the unit testing framework to run/debug the functional tests.

This is kind of a plug and play framework. The idea has been imlemented using the cleartrip website (http://www.cleartrip.com/).
You can simply do the following to make it work for your project.
* Create page classes for your project under the pages directory.
* Create specification for your project according to user of your system under the spec directory.
* Use domain directory to deal with domain level objects in the test. 
* Take clues from the existing cleartrip example for all of the above.
